I updated the RunDataTransformer.py and added UseIndex.py
The updated results of assignment 2 are also uploaded.

A one or two sentence answer each to both the questions: What was the most

The easiest part was getting all the onformation from DocumentIDFile.txt, InvertedIndex.json and InvertedIndex.txt
